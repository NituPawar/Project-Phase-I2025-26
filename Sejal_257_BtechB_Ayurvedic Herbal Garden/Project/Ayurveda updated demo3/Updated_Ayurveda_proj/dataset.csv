Constipation,"Take Triphala powder with warm water at night to stimulate gentle bowel movements and support overall digestive cleansing. Eat ripe papaya or a banana during the day, as their natural fiber helps soften stools and improves bowel regularity. Include flax seeds in your diet—either soaked overnight or ground and sprinkled over meals—to increase fiber intake and ease constipation."
Gas / Bloating,"Prepare a post-meal infusion by boiling cumin, ajwain and fennel seeds in water, strain and sip warm to relieve trapped gas and reduce bloating. Avoid late heavy dinners and minimize gas-producing foods (beans, cruciferous vegetables) until symptoms settle.

Gentle abdominal massage clockwise and light walking after eating can assist in moving gas along the digestive tract."
Hair fall,"Perform a scalp oil massage 2–3 times a week using warmed Bhringraj or Amla oil for 10–15 minutes to nourish hair roots and improve blood flow; leave oil on for at least an hour or overnight before mild shampooing. Rinse hair occasionally with diluted neem leaf water to maintain scalp hygiene and reduce dandruff-related hair loss. Support hair health from within by including amla, protein-rich foods, iron- and zinc-containing foods (beans, leafy greens, nuts), and avoid tight hairstyles, harsh chemical treatments and excessive heat styling. Manage stress through relaxation practices as chronic stress contributes to shedding."
Dandruff,"Prepare a Shikakai paste or use coconut oil mixed with a little lemon and massage into the scalp; leave for 20–30 minutes then rinse gently to help reduce flaking and restore scalp balance. Rinse hair occasionally with diluted neem water to reduce fungal overgrowth or irritation.

If the skin is cracking or itchy, add omega-3 rich foods or supplements after checking for allergies."

Drink Tulsi water or Tulsi tea daily to support internal detox and reduce inflammation.
